# Google Apps Script Data Automation

This repository contains a Google Apps Script project that demonstrates data automation in Google Sheets. The script provided sorts and highlights data based on specific criteria, showcasing the capabilities of Google Apps Script for automating tasks within Google Sheets.

## Project Overview

The project includes a Google Apps Script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Sorting Data**: The script sorts data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet alphabetically by the "Name" column.

2. **Conditional Formatting**: It applies conditional formatting to highlight cells in the "Age" column where the age is greater than or equal to 30.

## Getting Started

To test the script and observe its functionality, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Google Sheets Spreadsheet](#link-to-your-google-sheet) provided for testing.

2. Go to "Extensions" > "Apps Script" within the Google Sheets interface.

3. Replace the default code in the script editor with the code provided in the [`Code.gs`](Code.gs) file in this repository.

4. Save the script.

5. Click the play button in the script editor to run the `sortAndHighlightData` function.

6. Observe the data being sorted alphabetically by the "Name" column, and cells in the "Age" column with values greater than or equal to 30 being highlighted.
